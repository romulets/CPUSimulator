# CPUSimulator
It simulates how a CPU pay attention to processes

## How it works?
Just set up the process that you want in the file [data.txt](data.txt)

Each process has three parameters
 - Start time: it sets when the process is supposed to start
 - Duration: for how many times the process should live
 - Priority: the priority of the process. It works in descendant way (1 > 2)
